# Hotel and Restaurant Booking Application

## Project Overview
This application allows users to search for and book hotels and restaurants. It includes user authentication, a customer dashboard, and a search filter to refine listings based on various criteria.

## Completed Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- **Navigation Bar**: A persistent navigation bar that includes links to Home, Search, Login, and Register pages.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for listings based on:
  - Query
  - Price Range
  - Rating
  - Listing Type (Hotel or Restaurant)
- **Customer Dashboard**: Displays available listings and user bookings.

## Features in Progress
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Currently under development; will allow vendors to manage their listings.
- **Search Results Page**: Needs to be implemented to display filtered results based on user input.
- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Functionality for users to leave reviews and ratings for listings is not yet available.

## Next Steps
- Complete the vendor dashboard functionality.
- Implement the search results page to show filtered listings.
- Add user reviews and ratings features.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.

## Challenges Faced
- **State Management**: Managing state and props effectively across multiple components has been challenging.
- **Incomplete Features**: Some features are not functioning as intended, leading to a lack of cohesion in the user experience.

## Plans to Overcome Challenges
- Refactor components to improve state management, potentially using React Context or Redux.
- Prioritize completing the vendor dashboard and search results page to enhance overall functionality.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
